# Audio Classification using Deep Learning





## Name
Audio Classification 

## Description
We have made a classification from data extracted from an audio corpus. Knowing that the audio signals can be converted into spectrograms (thus images), we will be able to use them to load our learning and test bases.
Once the data are loaded and processed, we have defined two models (MLP and CNN) that will allow us to classify the input images on ten different classes of sounds.

To do this, we started by implementing for each of them, a feed-forward neural network architecture and then train them with the back-propagation algorithm (backward ). Then we wrote a function to define the accuracy of each model by measuring the efficiency of the latter as a proportion of real results on the total number of cases. Finally we evaluated them by tests to know which one is the most efficient in this situation.
